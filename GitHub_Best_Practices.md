# GitHub Best Practices for Publishing Projects

## Security and Sensitive Data Protection

### 1. Never Commit Sensitive Information
- **API Keys**: Never commit actual API keys to your repository
- **Passwords**: Never include passwords or secret tokens
- **Connection Strings**: Database connection strings often contain credentials
- **Private Keys**: SSH keys, encryption keys, etc.
- **Personal Information**: User data, email addresses, etc.

### 2. Use Environment Variables
- Store sensitive information in environment variables
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Always include `.env` in your `.gitignore`
- Provide a `.env.template` or `.env.example` with placeholder values

### 3. Implement Proper .gitignore
- Use a comprehensive `.gitignore` file appropriate for your project type
- Include:
  - Environment files (`.env`)
  - Virtual environment directories
  - Build artifacts and compiled code
  - Log files
  - Cache directories
  - IDE-specific files
  - OS-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

### 4. Scan for Sensitive Data Before Pushing
- Review changes before committing: `git diff`
- Use tools like `git-secrets` or `trufflehog` to scan for sensitive data
- Consider setting up pre-commit hooks to automate scanning

## Repository Configuration

### 1. README.md
- Include a clear, concise description of your project
- Document installation and setup instructions
- List dependencies and requirements
- Provide usage examples
- Explain configuration options (including environment variables)
- Include license information

### 2. LICENSE
- Always include a license file
- Choose an appropriate license for your project
- Understand the implications of your chosen license

### 3. Documentation
- Document your code with comments
- Provide API documentation if applicable
- Include a CONTRIBUTING.md file for contribution guidelines
- Consider adding a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file

### 4. Branch Management
- Use a consistent branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow)
- Protect your main/master branch
- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete branches after merging

## GitHub-Specific Best Practices

### 1. GitHub Actions
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Store secrets in GitHub Secrets, not in workflow files
- Validate your workflow files before pushing

### 2. GitHub Issues and Projects
- Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking and feature requests
- Set up project boards for task management
- Use labels and milestones effectively

### 3. Pull Requests
- Use pull requests for all changes
- Implement code review processes
- Use templates for pull requests
- Link pull requests to issues

### 4. GitHub Pages
- Consider using GitHub Pages for documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date
